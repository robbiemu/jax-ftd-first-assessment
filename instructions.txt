Create a file storage application.
It should consist of three application layers; presentation, domain, and persistence.

The Presentation Layer - JavaScript Command Line Interface (CLI)

Develop a command line interface for the file storage application using JavaScript and the Vorpal library.
It should connect to the back-end Java server and allow its user to register with the file storage application,
following which the user should be able to choose files on his or her local machine to store in the application's
database. The user should be able to view a list of files he or she has stored in the database, as well as choose
files from that list to download and recreate on his or her local machine.

In order to achieve this, implement the following vorpal commands:
  * register <username> <password>
    * should register a new user with the application
    * the plaintext password shouldn't be stored anywhere, ever
    * the password should be hashed for storage according to the bcrypt algorithm
  * login <username> <password>
    * should log a user in to the command line interface
    * the plaintext password shouldn't be stored anywhere, ever
    * the commandline application should store the user details necessary for logged-in functionality
    * the hashed password should compared on the client side

The following commands should not be available unless a user is logged in
  * files
    * should retrieve a list of files previously stored by the user
    * should display the file ids and paths as stored in the database
  * upload <local file path> [path stored in database]
    * should select a local file based on the local file path
    * it should read that file and send it to the server
    * and it should optionally allow the user to save the file in the database under a different specified path
    * (bonus) implement vorpal autocomplete for local files
  * download <database file id> [local file path]
    * should request a file from the server with the specified id
    * by default, it should store that file locally under the path stored in the database
    * the user should be optionally able to specify an alternate local path

General Requirements (CLI)
  * Vorpal command "actions" should be implemented by returning promises

General Recommendations (CLI)
  * Every command opens and closes a new connection to the server

The Domain Layer - Java Server
  * Model client commands and response data as objects and use JAXB/Moxy to serialize and deserialize that data as JSON
  * JAXB/Moxy is a requirement
  * Must be able to handle many client connections concurrently
  * It must store all user data (files and authentication details) on its associated database server
  * Files to be shared can be of any type or encoding
  * An ExecutorService must be used to handle a many-threaded situation

General Recommendations (Server)
  * Test JAXB serialization and deserialization of JSON outside of the application structure
  * Don't try to force JAXB to do exactly what you'd like it to
  * Organize your JDBC code into Dao like I demonstrated

The Persistence Layer - MySQL Database Server
  * Must store the following user data:
    * username
      * unique
    * password (only store hashed (60 characters))
      * not null
  * Must store the following file data:
    * absolute file path
      * not null
    * file data
      * stored as a BLOB

General Recommendations
  * Start with DB schema creation
  * Accross all layers, keep naming consistent
